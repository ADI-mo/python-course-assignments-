In the lab we work a lot with growth curves of bacteria, so I built a code that calculates the growth rate for bacteria/cells based on data of the sub-concentration, final concentration and the elapsed time in units of a generation per unit of time. I built 3 types of ainterctive code with input, command line and GUI, for this purpose I used Gimni 2.5 I wrote to it:
Write code to calculate growth rate with GUI
Write a code to calculate growth rate with ainterctive with input,
Write a code to calculate growth rate with command line
I made some adjustments to the code
