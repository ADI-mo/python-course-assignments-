**Modular Growth Rate Calculator**
n the lab we work a lot with growth curves of bacteria, so I built a code that calculates the growth rate for bacteria/cells
. The goal is to accurately calculate the specific growth rate (k) of bacteria or cells using concentration and time data.


**The Core Logic: The Calculation Function**

The central calculation is handled by a single, reusable function (located in a file calculator_logic.py). This function applies the formula for exponential growth.

The Formula

The specific growth rate (k) is calculated using the natural logarithm of the final concentration (N_t) relative to the initial concentration (N_0) over the elapsed time (t):

k = ln(N_t) - \ln(N_0)\t

The Outputs

The function returns the following key metrics, which define the growth characteristics of the culture: 

Interactive Implementations (User Interfaces)

The core growth_rate function is imported and utilized by three different front-ends, ensuring accessibility across various computing environments.

A. Command Line Interface (CLI)

Values ​​are typically passed as arguments when running the script (e.g., python cli_app.py <Ni> <Nf> <Time>).

User Experience: Fast and efficient, requiring no graphical environment.

B. Simple Interactive Input: This method uses sequential prompts to gather data from the user in a conversational manner.
The script prompts the user for each value using the standard input() function (e.g., "Enter Initial Concentration:").
A simple, step-by-step approach that clearly guides the user through the required data points.

C. Graphical User Interface (GUI)

This implementation provides the most user-friendly experience, minimizing errors through dedicated input fields and visual feedback.
Data is entered into designated text fields within a desktop application window (built with Tkinter).
Highly visual, featuring a dedicated "Calculate" button, clear display of results, and better handling of potential input errors.

. Project Advantages
The modular design provides significant benefits for lab work:
Consistency: All three interfaces use the identical calculation logic, guaranteeing the results are always the same.
Flexibility: Users can choose the interface that best suits their current task or computing environment.
Maintainability: If the growth rate formula needs adjustment, the change only needs to be made in one file (the core logic module), instantly updating all three interfaces.
The code was written using AI - Gimni 2.5, I instructed him to write a function for calculating the growth rate, then I instructed him to write code for calculating the growth rate with GUI based on this
Writing code for calculating the growth rate with interactive input,
Writing code for calculating the growth rate with command line,
I made some adjustments to the code.
