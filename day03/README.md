🧪 Modular Growth Rate Calculator (Python, SciPy, Matplotlib)This is a modular Python project designed to calculate and analyze the specific growth rate ($k$) of biological populations (e.g., bacteria, cells) using time-concentration (Time-Series) data.✨ Key FeaturesSingle-Point Calculation ($k$): Basic method based on $N_0$ and $N_t$.Multi-Point Fit: Uses linear regression (SciPy) for accurate growth curve analysis across multiple data points.Graphical Interface (GUI): Load data, plot graphs (Matplotlib), and display results in a user-friendly window.File Loading: Ability to load data directly from CSV or TXT files.📈 Linear Regression PrincipleLinear Regression is a statistical tool used to find the line of best fit for a set of data points. In this project, we use it to calculate the growth rate ($k$) reliably, even when noise is present in the lab data.Logarithmic Transformation: Cell growth is an exponential process. To transform it into a linear process, we apply a logarithmic transformation to the concentration (base 2):$$ \\ \log\_2(N) = \log\_2(N\_0) + k \cdot t
$$$$$$Where $\log_2(N)$ is the vertical axis, and $t$ is the horizontal axis.Finding the Slope: After the transformation, the data points form a straight line, and SciPy's linear regression finds the slope of this line:$$ \\ \text{Slope} = k
$$$$$$The slope ($k$) is the specific growth rate per unit of time, representing the number of doublings (Generations) per unit of time.$R^2$ Metric: We also calculate the Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$). This value (between 0 and 1) shows how well the straight line fits the $\log_2$ data. An $R^2$ closer to 1.0 indicates a better fit for the exponential growth phase.⚠️ Important Usage Note:This mathematical model is valid only for the exponential growth phase of the culture. You must input only the data points corresponding to this phase to get an accurate $k$ value. The $R^2$ value can be used as a measure for selecting the correct points.🏗️ Project StructureThe business logic is completely separated from the interface, ensuring stability and ease of testing.FileRoleKey Librariescalculator_logic.pyBusiness Logic.

🚀 Running the Application (GUI)This is the main way to use the upgraded application:python growth_rateGUI.py
Usage: Enter time and concentration points or use the "Load Data from File" button. Click "Calculate & Plot Growth Rate (k)" to get the fitted results and the graph.📁 File Format for Data LoadingWhen you click "Load Data from File", the file must meet the following conditions:Format: Text file (.txt) or CSV (.csv).Two-Column Structure:Column 1: Time (t). Must be a non-negative value ($\ge 0$).Column 2: Concentration (N). Must be a positive value ($> 0$).Delimiter: Columns can be separated by commas (,), tabs, or spaces.Comments: Lines starting with # or empty lines are ignored.Example File Content:# Time (Hours), Concentration (OD)

In this case, the function manually returns $k=0.0$ and $R^2=1.0$, which is the logically correct result and resolves the statistical error.
